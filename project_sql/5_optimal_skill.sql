-- Rewriting above because in having clause I am still a bit tripped up how andd when it works. So I am I believe just showing the work having clause is doing in the background to see what it is filtering for. Old note: VS HAVING count(*) > 10 where it would count most number of rows for any column even if that row has null. However by specfiying a column, it will look at the column and only count where

-- now if there were some null values in job_id then job_id select statement would show some false if I took off the limit. However because every instance of a skill is linked to a job_id both will yield same results...
/* 

in essence, Having isnâ€™t filtering on the aggregated results 
but rather respecting the groups and if I need to do another aggregation 
it will do it by the groups in the background (in terms of calculation)
and further refine my results.
